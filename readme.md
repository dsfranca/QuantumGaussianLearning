## Global vs Local
This script generates the error in the reconstruction comparing the local versus the global reconstruction error for the 1D Hamiltonian described in the paper iterating over various values of $m$.

## Plotter error norm
This one generates the plot for the local vs global plot.

## Scaling l
This script compares the quality of reconstruction as a function of $l$ for the $1D$ system and a given value of samples.

## Plotter l
This one generates the plots for the comparisong of the quality as a function of $l$.
